# üõ°Ô∏è RLS Policy Strategy Guide

**Date**: September 30, 2024  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented

---

## üìã Executive Summary

This guide documents the comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) policy strategy for Guardian AI CRM. All policies follow a strict pattern that eliminates "role does not exist" errors and ensures compatibility with modern Supabase architecture.

---

## üéØ Core Principle

**ALWAYS use `TO public` with custom profile claim filters**

### ‚ùå NEVER DO THIS

```sql
-- These cause "role does not exist" errors (SQLSTATE 22023, 42704)
CREATE POLICY "my_policy" ON my_table 
    FOR SELECT 
    TO authenticated  -- ‚ùå WRONG
    USING (...);

CREATE POLICY "my_policy" ON my_table 
    FOR SELECT 
    TO super_admin  -- ‚ùå WRONG
    USING (...);

CREATE POLICY "my_policy" ON my_table 
    FOR SELECT 
    TO service_role  -- ‚ùå WRONG
    USING (...);

CREATE POLICY "my_policy" ON my_table
    FOR INSERT
    WITH CHECK (true);  -- ‚ùå TOO PERMISSIVE
```

### ‚úÖ ALWAYS DO THIS

```sql
-- Correct pattern: TO public + custom profile claim filter
CREATE POLICY "Super admins can view all" ON my_table
    FOR SELECT
    TO public  -- ‚úÖ CORRECT
    USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM profiles
            WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid()
            AND profiles.role = 'super_admin'  -- ‚úÖ Custom claim
        )
    );

-- For organization-scoped access
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their organization data" ON my_table
    FOR SELECT
    TO public  -- ‚úÖ CORRECT
    USING (
        organization_id IN (
            SELECT organization_id FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid()
        )
    );

-- For authenticated-only access
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can insert" ON my_table
    FOR INSERT
    TO public  -- ‚úÖ CORRECT
    WITH CHECK (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);
```

---

## üîí Policy Patterns by Use Case

### 1. Super Admin Full Access

```sql
-- SELECT (Read)
CREATE POLICY "Super admins can view all records" ON your_table
    FOR SELECT
    TO public
    USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM profiles
            WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid()
            AND profiles.role = 'super_admin'
        )
    );

-- INSERT (Create)
CREATE POLICY "Super admins can insert records" ON your_table
    FOR INSERT
    TO public
    WITH CHECK (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM profiles
            WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid()
            AND profiles.role = 'super_admin'
        )
    );

-- UPDATE (Modify)
CREATE POLICY "Super admins can update records" ON your_table
    FOR UPDATE
    TO public
    USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM profiles
            WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid()
            AND profiles.role = 'super_admin'
        )
    );

-- DELETE (Remove)
CREATE POLICY "Super admins can delete records" ON your_table
    FOR DELETE
    TO public
    USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM profiles
            WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid()
            AND profiles.role = 'super_admin'
        )
    );
```

### 2. Super Admin OR Organization Member Access

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Super admins and org members can view" ON your_table
    FOR SELECT
    TO public
    USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM profiles
            WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid()
            AND profiles.role = 'super_admin'
        ) OR
        organization_id IN (
            SELECT organization_id FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid()
        )
    );
```

### 3. Organization-Only Access

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their organization data" ON your_table
    FOR SELECT
    TO public
    USING (
        organization_id IN (
            SELECT organization_id FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid()
        )
    );

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert in their organization" ON your_table
    FOR INSERT
    TO public
    WITH CHECK (
        organization_id IN (
            SELECT organization_id FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid()
        )
    );

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their organization data" ON your_table
    FOR UPDATE
    TO public
    USING (
        organization_id IN (
            SELECT organization_id FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid()
        )
    );

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their organization data" ON your_table
    FOR DELETE
    TO public
    USING (
        organization_id IN (
            SELECT organization_id FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid()
        )
    );
```

### 4. User-Owned Records Only

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own records" ON your_table
    FOR SELECT
    TO public
    USING (user_id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own records" ON your_table
    FOR INSERT
    TO public
    WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own records" ON your_table
    FOR UPDATE
    TO public
    USING (user_id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own records" ON your_table
    FOR DELETE
    TO public
    USING (user_id = auth.uid());
```

### 5. Authenticated Access with Conditions

```sql
-- Anyone authenticated can read
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view" ON your_table
    FOR SELECT
    TO public
    USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

-- Authenticated users can insert with validation
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can insert valid records" ON your_table
    FOR INSERT
    TO public
    WITH CHECK (
        auth.uid() IS NOT NULL 
        AND (your_validation_condition_here)
    );
```

## üîÑ Robust Policy Modification Pattern

When modifying policies on tables that may not exist:

```sql
DO $$
BEGIN
    IF EXISTS (
        SELECT FROM information_schema.tables
        WHERE table_schema = 'public'
        AND table_name = 'your_table'
    ) THEN
        -- Drop old policies
        DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "old_policy_name" ON your_table;
        
        -- Create new policies
        CREATE POLICY "new_policy_name" ON your_table
            FOR SELECT
            TO public
            USING (
                EXISTS (
                    SELECT 1 FROM profiles
                    WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid()
                    AND profiles.role = 'super_admin'
                )
            );
    END IF;
END $$;
```

## üéì Why This Approach?

### ‚úÖ Benefits

1. **No Role Errors**: Eliminates `"role does not exist"` errors (SQLSTATE 22023, 42704)
2. **JWT Compatible**: Works seamlessly with JWT custom claims
3. **Edge Function Ready**: Compatible with Supabase Edge Functions
4. **Consistent**: Same pattern across all tables and policies
5. **Testable**: Easy to test and debug authorization logic
6. **Scalable**: Can add more roles without database role management
7. **Auditable**: Clear, readable authorization logic

### ‚ùå Problems with Old Approach

```sql
-- Old approach (BROKEN)
CREATE POLICY "policy" ON table FOR SELECT TO super_admin USING (...);
```

**Problems:**
- ‚ùå Requires creating Postgres roles (`CREATE ROLE super_admin`)
- ‚ùå Role must exist before policy can be created
- ‚ùå Doesn't work with JWT custom claims
- ‚ùå Incompatible with Edge Functions
- ‚ùå Hard to test and debug
- ‚ùå Requires complex role management

## üìä Migration Checklist

When creating new tables with RLS:

- [ ] Enable RLS on table: `ALTER TABLE your_table ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`
- [ ] Create SELECT policy with `TO public` and custom filters
- [ ] Create INSERT policy with `TO public` and `WITH CHECK` validation
- [ ] Create UPDATE policy with `TO public` and custom filters
- [ ] Create DELETE policy with `TO public` and custom filters
- [ ] Test policies with different user roles
- [ ] Document policy logic in comments
- [ ] Add to migration file with table existence checks

---

## üß™ Testing Policies

### Test Script Template

```sql
-- Test as super admin
SET request.jwt.claims TO '{"sub": "super-admin-uuid", "role": "authenticated"}';

-- Verify super admin can see all records
SELECT * FROM your_table;  -- Should return all records

-- Test as regular user
SET request.jwt.claims TO '{"sub": "regular-user-uuid", "role": "authenticated"}';

-- Verify regular user only sees their organization
SELECT * FROM your_table;  -- Should return only org records

-- Test as unauthenticated (should fail or return nothing)
RESET request.jwt.claims;
SELECT * FROM your_table;  -- Should return empty or fail
```

## üö® Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ‚ùå Using `TO authenticated` instead of `TO public` with auth check
2. ‚ùå Using `TO super_admin` or any internal role name
3. ‚ùå Using `WITH CHECK (true)` without proper validation
4. ‚ùå Forgetting to wrap policy modifications in table existence checks
5. ‚ùå Not testing policies with different user types
6. ‚ùå Creating policies before enabling RLS on table

---

## ‚úÖ Verification

Run the verification script to check policy compliance:

```bash
./scripts/verify-rls-policies.sh
```

Expected output:
```
‚úÖ All critical checks passed!

RLS Policy Best Practices:
  1. ‚úÖ Always use TO public (never TO authenticated/super_admin/service_role)
  2. ‚úÖ Always filter by custom profile claims (profiles.role = 'super_admin')
  3. ‚úÖ Avoid WITH CHECK (true) - use proper authorization checks
  4. ‚úÖ Wrap policy modifications in DO blocks with table existence checks
```
