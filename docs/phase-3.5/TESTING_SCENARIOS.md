## ðŸ”¬ **PHASE 1: PRE-MIGRATION TESTING**

### **1.1: Baseline Functionality Test**

**Objective**: Establish current system performance and functionality baselines

#### **Test Scenario 1A: Current Credit Consumption**

```sql
-- Test current unified credit system
-- Record baseline performance metrics
\timing on

SELECT
    id,
    name,
    total_credits,
    used_credits,
    (total_credits - used_credits) as remaining_credits
FROM organizations
WHERE id = 'test-org-baseline-uuid';

-- Test current credit consumption function
SELECT consume_credits_rpc(
    'test-org-baseline-uuid',
    'ai_chat',
    10
);

\timing off
```

**Expected Results**:

- Query execution time: <200ms
- Credit consumption successful
- Accurate credit balance calculation
- No errors in function execution

#### **Test Scenario 1B: Current System Load Test**

```sql
-- Simulate 100 concurrent credit consumptions
DO $$
DECLARE
    i INTEGER;
    start_time TIMESTAMP;
    end_time TIMESTAMP;
BEGIN
    start_time := clock_timestamp();

    FOR i IN 1..100 LOOP
        PERFORM consume_credits_rpc(
            'load-test-org-uuid',
            'ai_chat',
            1
        );
    END LOOP;

    end_time := clock_timestamp();

    RAISE NOTICE 'Load test completed in %ms',
        EXTRACT(milliseconds FROM (end_time - start_time));
END $$;
```

**Expected Results**:

- Batch completion time: <5 seconds
- No errors or timeouts
- Data consistency maintained
- Performance within acceptable limits

### **1.2: Data Integrity Baseline**

    total_credits,
    used_credits,
    created_at,
    updated_at
FROM organizations;

-- Verify baseline snapshot
SELECT
    COUNT(*) as total_organizations,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN total_credits > 0 THEN 1 END) as orgs_with_credits,
