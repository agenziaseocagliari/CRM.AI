## 🔧 CRITICAL BUG FIX - Company Field Space Issue

### Problem Identified
- **Issue**: Company field in Contacts form was blocking/removing spaces in company names
- **User Impact**: Impossible to enter companies like "SEO Cagliari" (became "SEOCagliari")
- **Root Cause**: `InputValidator.sanitizeString()` applied universally to all form fields

### Solution Implemented
- **File Modified**: `/src/components/Contacts.tsx`
- **Approach**: Created field-specific sanitization logic in `handleFormChange` function
- **Company Field Sanitization**: 
  - ✅ **Preserves spaces and business punctuation** (periods, hyphens, apostrophes)
  - ✅ **Still prevents XSS** (removes `<>`, `javascript:`, event handlers)  
  - ✅ **200-character limit** for company names
- **Other Fields**: Continue using standard `InputValidator.sanitizeString()`

### Test Results
```javascript
// Before: "SEO Cagliari" → "SEOCagliari" ❌
// After:  "SEO Cagliari" → "SEO Cagliari" ✅
```

## ⚡ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS

### React Performance Enhancements
- ✅ **React.memo()** on all dashboard components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- ✅ **useCallback()** for event handlers and functions passed as props
- ✅ **useMemo()** for expensive calculations (lead source data, stats)
- ✅ **Efficient data fetching** with parallel Promise.all() calls

### Data Loading Strategy
```typescript
// Parallel data fetching for better performance
const [stats, activities] = await Promise.all([
  DashboardService.getDashboardStats(organization.id),
  DashboardService.getRecentActivity(organization.id, 8)
]);
```

### Database Query Optimization
- ✅ **Selective field queries**: Only fetch needed columns
- ✅ **Proper indexing**: Queries use organization_id and created_at
- ✅ **Batch operations**: Single queries for multiple metrics
- ✅ **Client-side aggregation**: Reduce database load
