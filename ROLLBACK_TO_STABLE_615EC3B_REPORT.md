## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

### For Vercel Deployment:
1. Go to Vercel project settings
2. Under "Build & Development Settings" → "Production Branch"
3. Change from `main` to `rollback/stable-615ec3b`
4. Trigger new deployment manually or wait for auto-deploy

**OR** use the CLI:
```bash
# Deploy from rollback branch
git checkout rollback/stable-615ec3b
npx vercel --prod
```

### For Supabase Deployment:
GitHub Actions workflows will **automatically deploy** when changes are pushed to `rollback/stable-615ec3b`:

```bash
# Any change to this branch will trigger deployment
git checkout rollback/stable-615ec3b
# Make changes if needed
git push origin rollback/stable-615ec3b
```

**Manual deployment**:
```bash
# Link to Supabase project
supabase link --project-ref qjtaqrlpronohgpfdxsi

# Push database migrations
supabase db push

# Deploy edge functions (if needed)
supabase functions deploy --no-verify-jwt
```

## ⚠️ ROLLBACK RATIONALE

### Issues with Recent Commits (post-615ec3b):
1. **Migration Sync Complexity**: Triple fallback logic added unnecessary complexity
2. **Build Configuration Changes**: esbuild/rollup/npm fixes may have introduced regressions
3. **Migration Idempotence Work**: Extensive refactoring of migration files
4. **Cumulative Instability**: 13 commits over multiple days created cascading issues

### Why 615ec3b is Stable:
- **Tested and Verified**: Commit represents a known-good state where all features worked
- **Clean State**: Before complex migration sync logic was added
- **Working Calendar**: Renewal Calendar "Dettagli" button routing correctly
- **Working PolicyDetail**: "Polizza non trovata" error resolved
- **Successful Deployments**: Supabase and Vercel deploys succeeding consistently

## 🔮 NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Actions (Now):
1. ✅ Rollback branch created and pushed
2. ✅ CI/CD workflows updated
3. ⏳ **Trigger fresh Vercel deployment** from `rollback/stable-615ec3b`
4. ⏳ **Verify Supabase deployment** via GitHub Actions
5. ⏳ **Test PolicyDetail and RenewalCalendar** in production

### Short-term (Next 24 hours):
1. Monitor production for any issues
2. Verify all user-reported problems are resolved
3. Review error logs for any new issues
4. Confirm all core features functioning correctly

## 📞 SUPPORT AND TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Rollback Deployment Fails:

#### Vercel Issues:
```bash
# Check deployment logs
npx vercel logs --prod

# Retry deployment
git checkout rollback/stable-615ec3b
npx vercel --prod --force
```

#### Supabase Issues:
```bash
# Check migration status
supabase migration list

# Force push migrations
supabase db push --force

# Check function logs
supabase functions logs generate-form-fields
```

#### GitHub Actions Issues:
1. Go to https://github.com/agenziaseocagliari/CRM.AI/actions
2. Find failed workflow run
3. Review logs for error details
4. Re-run failed jobs if transient failure

### If Features Still Not Working:

#### PolicyDetail Issues:
- Check `src/components/insurance/PolicyDetail.tsx` is from 615ec3b commit
- Verify Edge Function `generate-form-fields` is deployed
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Supabase RLS policies allow policy access

#### RenewalCalendar Issues:
- Verify routing configuration in `App.tsx`
- Check `renewal_reminders` view exists in database
- Verify "Dettagli" button `to` prop is `/insurance/policies/${policy.id}`
- Check `navigate()` call in button click handler
