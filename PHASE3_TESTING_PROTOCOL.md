## TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Issue: "contact_notes table does not exist"
**Solution**: Execute PHASE1_DATABASE_SCRIPTS.sql Script 1
**Verification**: Console should show "✅ Notes loaded successfully"

### Issue: "opportunities table does not exist"
**Solution**: Execute PHASE1_DATABASE_SCRIPTS.sql Script 2
**Verification**: Console should show "✅ Opportunities query result"

### Issue: Notes save but get error "null value violates not-null constraint"
**Check**: Console log showing what data is being sent
**Solution**: Verify contact_id and created_by are valid UUIDs

### Issue: Opportunities create but don't show in pipeline
**Check**: Console logs for opportunities loading
**Look for**: organization_id mismatch between created opportunity and query
**Solution**: Verify organization context in both creation and loading

### Issue: "permission denied for table"
**Solution**: Check RLS policies were created correctly
**Verification**: Re-run the policy sections of PHASE1_DATABASE_SCRIPTS.sql
