## 🔧 CHANGES APPLIED

### Before (❌ Incorrect)
```sql
CREATE POLICY "profiles_select_policy" ON profiles
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated  -- ❌ Wrong: references internal database role
  USING (...);
```

### After (✅ Correct)
```sql
CREATE POLICY "profiles_select_policy" ON profiles
  FOR SELECT
  TO public  -- ✅ Correct: uses public role
  USING (...);
```

---

## 📝 DETAILED POLICY SPECIFICATIONS

### Policy 1: SELECT - `profiles_select_policy`
```sql
CREATE POLICY "profiles_select_policy" ON profiles
  FOR SELECT
  TO public  -- ✅ Corrected from TO authenticated
  USING (
    -- User can always view their own profile
    auth.uid() = id
    OR
    -- Super admins can view all profiles
    COALESCE(
      auth.jwt() ->> 'user_role',
      (auth.jwt() -> 'user_metadata') ->> 'user_role'
    ) = 'super_admin'
    OR
    -- Users can view profiles in their organization
    (
      organization_id IS NOT NULL AND
      organization_id IN (
        SELECT organization_id 
        FROM profiles 
        WHERE id = auth.uid() AND organization_id IS NOT NULL
      )
    )
  );
```

**Access Control**:
- ✅ Users can view own profile
- ✅ Users can view organization members' profiles
- ✅ Super admins can view all profiles
- ✅ NULL organization_id handled gracefully

---

### Policy 2: INSERT - `profiles_insert_policy`
```sql
CREATE POLICY "profiles_insert_policy" ON profiles
  FOR INSERT
  TO public  -- ✅ Corrected from TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (
    -- User can insert their own profile
    auth.uid() = id
    OR
    -- Super admins can insert any profile
    COALESCE(
      auth.jwt() ->> 'user_role',
      (auth.jwt() -> 'user_metadata') ->> 'user_role'
    ) = 'super_admin'
  );
```

**Access Control**:
- ✅ Users can insert own profile (id matches auth.uid())
- ✅ Super admins can insert any profile
- ✅ Prevents users from creating profiles for others

---

### Policy 3: UPDATE - `profiles_update_policy`
```sql
CREATE POLICY "profiles_update_policy" ON profiles
  FOR UPDATE
  TO public  -- ✅ Corrected from TO authenticated
  USING (
    -- User can update their own profile
    auth.uid() = id
    OR
    -- Super admins can update any profile
    COALESCE(
      auth.jwt() ->> 'user_role',
      (auth.jwt() -> 'user_metadata') ->> 'user_role'
    ) = 'super_admin'
  )
  WITH CHECK (
    -- Same conditions for the updated data
    auth.uid() = id
    OR
    COALESCE(
      auth.jwt() ->> 'user_role',
      (auth.jwt() -> 'user_metadata') ->> 'user_role'
    ) = 'super_admin'
  );
```

**Access Control**:
- ✅ Users can update own profile
- ✅ Super admins can update any profile
- ✅ USING clause checks existing row permission
- ✅ WITH CHECK clause validates new data permission

---

### Policy 4: DELETE - `profiles_delete_policy`
```sql
CREATE POLICY "profiles_delete_policy" ON profiles
  FOR DELETE
  TO public  -- ✅ Corrected from TO authenticated
  USING (
    COALESCE(
      auth.jwt() ->> 'user_role',
      (auth.jwt() -> 'user_metadata') ->> 'user_role'
    ) = 'super_admin'
  );
```

**Access Control**:
- ✅ Only super admins can delete profiles
- ❌ Regular users cannot delete own profile (by design)
- ✅ Prevents accidental profile deletion

---

## 🎯 WHY `TO public` INSTEAD OF `TO authenticated`?

### PostgreSQL Role Architecture in Supabase

**Incorrect Approach** (❌):
```sql
CREATE POLICY ... TO authenticated;
-- References internal database role 'authenticated'
-- This role is managed by Supabase auth system
-- Should NEVER be referenced in user-defined policies
```

**Correct Approach** (✅):
```sql
CREATE POLICY ... TO public;
-- Uses standard PostgreSQL 'public' role
-- Combined with USING clause for actual access control
-- auth.uid() and auth.jwt() provide authentication context
```

### Key Principles

1. **`TO public`**: Defines the **role** the policy applies to
   - All Supabase users are effectively in the `public` role
   - The policy still applies to all authenticated requests

2. **`USING` clause**: Defines the **actual access control logic**
   - `auth.uid() = id` → Only access own records
   - `auth.jwt() ->> 'user_role' = 'super_admin'` → Check JWT claims
   - Organization checks, etc.

3. **Security Model**:
   - RLS is **always enabled** on the table
   - Even with `TO public`, users can only see rows that pass the `USING` clause
   - Authentication is verified via `auth.uid()` and `auth.jwt()`

---

## 🔒 SECURITY VALIDATION

### Authentication Layer
- ✅ All policies check `auth.uid()` for user identity
- ✅ JWT claims extracted for role validation
- ✅ Supports both top-level and user_metadata claims locations
- ✅ No anonymous access (all predicates require authenticated context)

### Authorization Layer
- ✅ Own profile access: `auth.uid() = id`
- ✅ Organization-scoped access: Organization membership checked
- ✅ Super admin privileges: JWT claim validation
- ✅ NULL-safe predicates: `COALESCE` used consistently

### Data Integrity
- ✅ INSERT: Users can only create own profile
- ✅ UPDATE: USING + WITH CHECK ensure consistent permissions
- ✅ DELETE: Restricted to super admins only
- ✅ SELECT: Multi-tier access (own, org, admin)

- [x] Policies are idempotent (can be rerun)
- [x] Clear policy names describing purpose

### Security Standards
- [x] No overly permissive policies (e.g., `USING (true)`)
- [x] No unauthenticated access paths
- [x] Principle of least privilege enforced
- [x] Defense in depth (multiple checks)

## 🧪 TESTING & VERIFICATION

### Manual Verification Commands

**1. Check for problematic TO clauses**:
```powershell
# Should return 0 results
Select-String -Path "supabase\migrations\*.sql" -Pattern "TO (authenticated|super_admin|service_role)"
```

**2. Verify TO public usage**:
```powershell
# Should return 4 results (one per policy)
Select-String -Path "supabase\migrations\20251020_profiles_rls_cleanup.sql" -Pattern "TO public"
```

**3. Count CREATE POLICY statements**:
```powershell
# Should return 4 results
Select-String -Path "supabase\migrations\20251020_profiles_rls_cleanup.sql" -Pattern "CREATE POLICY"
```

### Expected Results
```
✅ TO authenticated: 0 matches
✅ TO super_admin: 0 matches
✅ TO service_role: 0 matches
✅ TO public: 4 matches
✅ CREATE POLICY: 4 matches
```

### Database Verification (Post-Migration)

**Check policy definitions**:
```sql
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  policyname,
  cmd,
  roles
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'profiles'
ORDER BY policyname;
```

**Expected Output**:
```
schemaname | tablename | policyname              | cmd    | roles
-----------+-----------+------------------------+--------+--------
public     | profiles  | profiles_select_policy | SELECT | {public}
public     | profiles  | profiles_insert_policy | INSERT | {public}
public     | profiles  | profiles_update_policy | UPDATE | {public}
public     | profiles  | profiles_delete_policy | DELETE | {public}
```

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT READINESS

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [x] All `TO authenticated` replaced with `TO public`
- [x] No internal database role references
- [x] Policy logic preserved (only TO clause changed)
- [x] Idempotent migration (can be rerun safely)
- [x] No GRANT statements to problematic roles
- [x] Verification script passes (manual checks completed)

### Migration Safety
- ✅ **Backward Compatible**: Existing functionality preserved
- ✅ **No Breaking Changes**: Same access control logic
- ✅ **Idempotent**: DROP IF EXISTS used before CREATE
- ✅ **Verified**: Manual checks confirm correctness

### Rollback Plan
If issues occur, previous policies can be restored:
```sql
-- Rollback: Drop new policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_select_policy" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_insert_policy" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_update_policy" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_delete_policy" ON profiles;

-- Restore original policies (if needed)
-- Note: Original had 14 duplicate policies - do NOT restore those
```

## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

### Why This Matters

1. **Supabase Managed Roles**:
   - `authenticated`, `anon`, `service_role` are Supabase-managed
   - Should NOT be referenced in user policies
   - Use `TO public` with `auth.uid()` checks instead

2. **Security Through USING Clauses**:
   - `TO public` doesn't mean "public access"
   - `USING` clause enforces actual permissions
   - `auth.uid()` validates authenticated user context

3. **Best Practice Pattern**:
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "my_policy" ON my_table
     FOR SELECT
     TO public              -- ✅ Standard PostgreSQL role
     USING (
       auth.uid() = user_id -- ✅ Actual access control
     );
   ```
