# DataPizza Integration Cleanup Report

## üßπ PHASE 0: CLEANUP COMPLETE ‚úÖ

### Files Removed/Archived

1. **DATAPIZZA_API_DISCOVERY.md** ‚Üí **DATAPIZZA_API_DISCOVERY_ARCHIVED_INCORRECT.md**
   - **Reason**: Based on incorrect REST API assumption for lead enrichment
   - **Content**: Documented systematic search for non-existent API credentials
   - **Status**: Archived for reference, not deleted (maintains audit trail)

### Files Checked (Not Found)

- `src/services/datapizzaService.ts` - ‚ùå Not found (good)
- `test-datapizza-connection.ts` - ‚ùå Not found (good)
- Any REST API integration code - ‚ùå Not found (good)

### Cleanup Assessment

‚úÖ **NO incorrect integration code was created**  
‚úÖ **Only documentation file needed correction**  
‚úÖ **Codebase remains clean for correct implementation**

### What Was Wrong in Previous Approach

- **Assumption**: DataPizza was a REST API for lead enrichment
- **Reality**: DataPizza is a Python framework for AI agent orchestration
- **Impact**: Previous API credential search was irrelevant

### Files Kept

- `DATAPIZZA_API_DISCOVERY_ARCHIVED_INCORRECT.md` - Kept for audit trail and learning

## Status: READY FOR CORRECT DATAPIZZA FRAMEWORK INTEGRATION

**Next Phase**: Begin Phase 1 - Framework Assessment  
**Current State**: Clean workspace, no incorrect assumptions in code  
**Time Spent**: 5 minutes (efficient cleanup)
