# üìä DATABASE REALITY ANALYSIS (Based on Code Inspection)

## PHASE 0 DISCOVERY RESULTS

Since direct database access is blocked, I'm analyzing the codebase to understand expected structure.

### TABLE ANALYSIS FROM CODE:

**contacts table:**
- ‚úÖ EXISTS (heavily referenced in code)
- Fields found in code: id, name, email, phone, company, organization_id, created_at, notes
- Usage: src/components/Contacts.tsx, src/services/*, src/hooks/useCrmData.ts

**opportunities table:** 
- ‚úÖ EXPECTED (main deals table based on code)
- Fields found: id, contact_name, value, stage, assigned_to, close_date, organization_id, contact_id, created_at
- Usage: src/components/Opportunities.tsx, src/services/dashboardService.ts

**deals table:**
- ‚ùì POSSIBLY EXISTS (some references in dealsService.ts)
- May be legacy or alternative table

**pipeline_stages table:**
- ‚úÖ EXPECTED (referenced in opportunities queries)
- Fields: id, name, display_order, color, organization_id
- Stages expected: "New Lead", "Contacted", "Proposal Sent", "Won", "Lost"

**contact_notes table:**
- ‚ùå DOES NOT EXIST (this is the bug!)
- Expected fields: id, contact_id, note, created_at, created_by
- This is what we need to create

**organizations table:**
- ‚úÖ EXPECTED (organization_id references throughout)

### CODE PATTERNS DISCOVERED:

1. **Opportunities vs Deals confusion:**
   - ContactDetailModal.tsx uses both 'opportunities' and 'deals' 
   - Opportunities.tsx uses 'opportunities'
   - dealsService.ts uses 'deals'
   - **DECISION: Standardize on 'opportunities'**

2. **Pipeline stages:**
   - Code expects stage lookup by name: "New Lead"
   - Uses stage_id foreign key relationship
   - Need to ensure "New Lead" stage exists

3. **Contact notes issue:**
   - ContactDetailModal tries to query contact_notes table
   - Table doesn't exist = "relation does not exist" error
   - Need to create this table

## DATABASE_REALITY FORM (Inferred):

```
DATABASE_REALITY:
contacts_table:
  exists: YES (inferred from code usage)
  has_notes_field: UNKNOWN (but contact_notes table expected)

deals_opportunities:
  table_name: opportunities (standardizing on this)
  row_count: UNKNOWN
  key_fields: id, contact_name, value, stage, contact_id, organization_id, created_at

pipeline_stages:
  exists: YES (inferred - referenced in joins)
  stage_names: New Lead, Contacted, Proposal Sent, Won, Lost (from enum)
  new_lead_id: UNKNOWN (need to query)

contact_notes:
  table_exists: NO (this is the bug)

organizations:
  table_exists: YES (inferred from organization_id refs)
  required_for_queries: YES
```

## PROCEEDING TO PHASE 1

Since I can't query directly, I'll:
1. Create contact_notes table via SQL instructions
2. Ensure opportunities table structure is correct
3. Fix code to use consistent table names
4. Add extensive debugging to verify in browser
