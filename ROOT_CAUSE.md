# ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

## Based on forensic analysis, the root cause is:

**C**: React Router Issue

The Reports module uses **Next.js App Router architecture** in a **React Router application**.

## Evidence

### 1. Code Comparison Evidence:

- **Working Opportunities**: Located in `src/components/Opportunities.tsx` using React Router pattern
- **Broken Reports**: Located in `src/app/dashboard/reports/page.tsx` using Next.js App Router pattern

### 2. Import Path Evidence:

- **Working**: `import { supabase } from '../lib/supabaseClient';` (correct relative path from components/)
- **Broken**: `import { supabase } from '../../../lib/supabaseClient';` (wrong relative path from app/)

### 3. Test Page Evidence:

- **ReportsTest Component**: Successfully works using `src/components/ReportsTest.tsx` pattern
- **Proves**: The React Router + useOutletContext pattern works perfectly
- **Confirms**: The issue is architectural, not environmental or authentication

### 4. Architecture Evidence:

- **Working Pattern**: React Router component → useOutletContext → useCrmData hook
- **Broken Pattern**: Next.js 'use client' → custom auth → direct Supabase queries

## Explanation

The application is built as a **React Router SPA** with context-based data sharing via `useCrmData`. All working modules (Opportunities, Contacts, Calendar, Dashboard) use `useOutletContext` to access shared CRM data.

The Reports module was incorrectly implemented as a **Next.js 13+ App Router page** with:

- 'use client' directive
- Located in `src/app/` directory structure
- Custom `getUserOrganizationId()` authentication
- Direct Supabase queries instead of context

This creates an architectural mismatch where Reports cannot access the working CRM context that provides data to all other modules.

## Fix Required

**Exact steps to fix this specific issue:**

1. **Delete** `src/app/dashboard/reports/page.tsx` (wrong architecture)
2. **Create** `src/components/Reports.tsx` (correct architecture)
3. **Copy** exact pattern from `src/components/Opportunities.tsx`
4. **Modify** only the UI presentation layer (keep all data logic identical)
5. **Update** `src/App.tsx` import from Next.js path to React component path

The fix requires **zero** changes to authentication, environment variables, or database queries. It's purely an architectural alignment with the working pattern.
