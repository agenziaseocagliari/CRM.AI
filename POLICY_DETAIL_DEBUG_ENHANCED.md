# Policy Detail Enhanced Debug Implementation

## Overview
Enhanced the PolicyDetail component with comprehensive error handling and detailed logging to identify the root cause of the "Errore nel caricamento della polizza" error.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced fetchPolicy Function
- **Detailed Logging**: Added extensive console logging at each step of the data fetching process
- **Field Validation**: Added validation for all required fields (id, policy_number, policy_type, insurance_company, start_date, end_date, premium_amount, premium_frequency, status)
- **Date Validation**: Added specific validation for date fields to ensure they can be parsed correctly
- **Premium Validation**: Added validation for premium_amount to ensure it's a valid number
- **Error Details**: Enhanced error logging to capture full error context including code, message, details, and hint
- **Data Structure Logging**: Added logging of the complete policy object structure for debugging

### 2. Render Error Boundary
- **Try-Catch Wrapper**: Wrapped the main render function in a try-catch block to catch rendering errors
- **Error Display**: Added user-friendly error display with technical details for debugging
- **Graceful Fallback**: Provides a clean UI with navigation back to policy list if rendering fails

### 3. Logging Strategy
All logs are prefixed with `[PolicyDetail]` and use emojis for easy identification:
- 🔍 Data fetching
- 🏢 Organization filtering
- 🚀 Query execution
- 📊 Query results
- ✅ Success states
- ❌ Error states
- 🔧 Validation steps
- 📅 Date validation
- 💰 Premium validation
- 👤 Contact information
- 👥 User information
- 🎯 State updates
- 🎨 Rendering
- 💥 Critical errors

## Testing Steps

### 1. Open Browser Console
1. Navigate to the application at http://localhost:5174
2. Open browser developer tools (F12)
3. Go to the Console tab

### 2. Navigate to Policy Detail
1. Go to the insurance policies section
2. Click on the renewal calendar or policy list
3. Click on a policy to open the detail view
4. Watch the console for detailed logging

### 3. Analyze the Output
Look for the following in the console logs:

#### Expected Success Flow:
```
🔍 [PolicyDetail] Fetching policy with ID: [UUID]
🏢 [PolicyDetail] Filtering by organization ID: [UUID]
🚀 [PolicyDetail] Executing Supabase query...
📊 [PolicyDetail] Query result: { data: {...}, error: null }
✅ [PolicyDetail] Policy data received: {...}
🔧 [PolicyDetail] Validating policy data structure...
📅 [PolicyDetail] Validating dates: {...}
💰 [PolicyDetail] Validating premium amount: [number]
👤 [PolicyDetail] Contact information: {...}
👥 [PolicyDetail] Created by user: {...}
✅ [PolicyDetail] All validations passed, setting policy data
📋 [PolicyDetail] Final policy object: {...}
🎯 [PolicyDetail] Policy state set successfully
🏁 [PolicyDetail] fetchPolicy completed
🎨 [PolicyDetail] Starting render with policy: [policy_number]
```

#### Common Error Patterns to Look For:
1. **Missing Fields**: `❌ [PolicyDetail] Missing required fields: [field_names]`
2. **Invalid Dates**: `❌ [PolicyDetail] Invalid dates: {...}`
3. **Invalid Premium**: `❌ [PolicyDetail] Invalid premium amount: [value]`
4. **Database Errors**: `❌ [PolicyDetail] Error fetching policy: {...}`
5. **Rendering Errors**: `💥 [PolicyDetail] Rendering error: {...}`

## Next Steps Based on Console Output

### Case 1: Missing Required Fields
If you see missing required fields in the console:
1. Check the database schema for the insurance_policies table
2. Verify that all required columns exist and have data
3. Update the database migration if fields are missing

### Case 2: Invalid Dates
If you see invalid date errors:
1. Check the date format in the database (should be ISO 8601)
2. Verify that start_date and end_date are not null
3. Check for timezone issues

### Case 3: Invalid Premium Amount
If you see premium validation errors:
1. Check that premium_amount is stored as a numeric type
2. Verify no null values in the premium_amount column
3. Check for negative values

### Case 4: Database Connection Issues
If you see Supabase errors:
1. Check Supabase connection configuration
2. Verify RLS policies allow access to the policy
3. Check organization_id filtering logic

### Case 5: Rendering Errors
If you see rendering errors:
1. The error message will indicate which part of the UI failed
2. Check for null pointer exceptions in the component
3. Look for missing formatCurrency or other utility functions
