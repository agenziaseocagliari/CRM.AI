## 🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### The Problem

**User Report**:
- User: Insurance vertical (primassicurazionibari@gmail.com)
- Organization ID: dcfbec5c-6049-4d4d-ba80-a1c412a5861d
- File: "Assicurazione Auto Lucera.jpg" (122.5 KB)
- **Storage Upload**: ✅ SUCCESS (file reaches Supabase)
- **Database INSERT**: ❌ FAILED (RLS policy blocks)

**Error Message**:
```
new row violates row-level security policy for table "insurance_documents"
```

### RLS Policy Configuration

The INSERT policy on `insurance_documents` table requires TWO conditions:

```sql
WITH CHECK (
  (organization_id = ((auth.jwt() -> 'user_metadata'::text) ->> 'organization_id'::text)::uuid) 
  AND 
  (uploaded_by = auth.uid())
)
```

**Policy Breakdown**:
1. ✅ **organization_id** must match JWT claim → **WORKING**
2. ❌ **uploaded_by** must equal current user ID → **MISSING IN CODE**

### Diagnostic Results

**1. RLS Status**: ✅ Enabled on `insurance_documents`

**2. INSERT Policy**: ✅ Exists with correct structure
```
Policy Name: "Users can upload documents to their organization"
Command: INSERT
Permissive: PERMISSIVE
WITH CHECK: (organization_id = JWT org_id) AND (uploaded_by = auth.uid())
```

**3. JWT Claims Check**: ✅ User has organization_id in user_metadata
```json
{
  "organization_id": "dcfbec5c-6049-4d4d-ba80-a1c412a5861d",
  "vertical": "insurance",
  "user_role": "user",
  "email": "primassicurazionibari@gmail.com"
}
```

**4. Profile Check**: ✅ Profile exists with correct organization_id

**5. Code Review**: ❌ **BUG FOUND**
```typescript
// storageService.ts - BEFORE (BROKEN)
const { data: docData, error: dbError } = await supabase
  .from('insurance_documents')
  .insert({
    organization_id: options.organizationId,
    filename: filename,
    // ... other fields ...
    // ❌ MISSING: uploaded_by field
  });
```

---

## 🛠️ FIX APPLIED

### Code Changes

**File**: `src/services/storageService.ts`

**Change 1**: Get current user before INSERT
```typescript
// Get current user for uploaded_by field
const { data: { user }, error: userError } = await supabase.auth.getUser();

if (userError || !user) {
  console.error('❌ [AUTH ERROR] Cannot get current user:', userError);
  throw new Error('Utente non autenticato');
}

console.log('👤 [UPLOAD] Current user ID:', user.id);
console.log('🏢 [UPLOAD] Organization ID:', options.organizationId);
```

**Change 2**: Add uploaded_by field to INSERT
```typescript
const { data: docData, error: dbError } = await supabase
  .from('insurance_documents')
  .insert({
    organization_id: options.organizationId,
    filename: filename,
    original_filename: file.name,
    file_type: this.getFileType(file.type),
    mime_type: file.type,
    file_size: file.size,
    storage_bucket: bucket,
    storage_path: storagePath,
    public_url: urlData.publicUrl,
    document_category: options.category,
    document_type: options.documentType,
    related_entity_type: options.entityType,
    related_entity_id: options.entityId,
    description: options.description,
    tags: options.tags || [],
    uploaded_by: user.id  // ← FIX: Add uploaded_by field
  })
  .select()
  .single();
```

**Lines Changed**: +12 lines (authentication + field)

## 🎯 DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS CREATED

### File: `scripts/check-rls-policies.js` (190 lines)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive RLS policy diagnostic script

**Features**:
1. ✅ Check RLS enabled status
2. ✅ Inspect INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/SELECT policies
3. ✅ Verify JWT claims contain organization_id
4. ✅ Check profile database records
5. ✅ Policy security validation

**Usage**:
```bash
node scripts/check-rls-policies.js
```

**Output**:
```
🔍 CHECKING RLS POLICIES ON insurance_documents

1️⃣  RLS STATUS
   RLS Enabled: ✅ YES

2️⃣  INSERT POLICIES
   Policy: Users can upload documents to their organization
   WITH CHECK: (organization_id = JWT) AND (uploaded_by = auth.uid())

3️⃣  ALL POLICIES
   Total: 4 policies (DELETE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE)

4️⃣  JWT CLAIMS CHECK
   organization_id in user_metadata: ✅ dcfbec5c-6049-4d4d-ba80-a1c412a5861d

5️⃣  PROFILE CHECK
   ✅ Profile found with correct organization_id

📊 DIAGNOSIS SUMMARY
   ✅ INSERT policy exists
   ✅ JWT contains organization_id
   ⚠️  Code must set uploaded_by field
```

7. [ ] Verify: Upload progress shows
8. [ ] Verify: Success toast appears
9. [ ] Verify: Document appears in gallery
10. [ ] Verify: Can download document
11. [ ] Verify: Can delete document

**Expected Result**: All steps pass ✅

**Step 2: Database Verification**
```bash
node scripts/check-rls-policies.js
# Should show:
# - RLS enabled: YES
# - INSERT policy: ACTIVE
# - Organization isolation: ENFORCED
```

**Step 3: Security Test** (Optional)
1. Login with different organization user
2. Navigate to Policy Detail
3. Try to upload document
4. Verify: Upload succeeds with DIFFERENT organization_id
5. Verify: Cannot see documents from other organizations

## 💡 LESSONS LEARNED

### Key Insights

**1. RLS Policy Debugging**:
- Always check BOTH policy conditions (organization_id AND uploaded_by)
- Use diagnostic scripts to verify JWT claims
- Check code sets ALL required fields

**2. Supabase Client Auth**:
- Use `supabase.auth.getUser()` to get current user
- Check for `userError` before proceeding
- Populate audit fields (uploaded_by, created_by, updated_by)

**3. Error Messages**:
- "RLS policy violation" → Check INSERT WITH CHECK clause
- Missing fields in INSERT → Policy will block
- JWT claims must match policy expectations

### Best Practices Applied

✅ **Diagnostic First**: Created comprehensive diagnostic script  
✅ **Root Cause Analysis**: Identified exact missing field  
✅ **Minimal Fix**: Changed only 12 lines (authentication + field)  
✅ **Zero Downtime**: Fix deployed without service interruption  
✅ **Documentation**: Created detailed completion report
