## ‚ö†Ô∏è **RISK MITIGATION CHECKLIST**

### **üö® HIGH RISK ITEMS**

#### **1. Data Integrity Risks**

- [ ] **Migration logic** validated: Credit allocation formulas tested
- [ ] **Data constraints** verified: No constraint violations possible
- [ ] **Referential integrity** maintained: Foreign key relationships preserved

### **üîç MEDIUM RISK ITEMS**

#### **1. Integration Risks**

- [ ] **API compatibility** maintained: External integrations continue working
- [ ] **Frontend adaptation** ready: UI updates for multi-credit system
- [ ] **Third-party services** stable: All external dependencies operational
- [ ] **Webhook functionality** verified: Credit consumption webhooks working

#### **2. Configuration Risks**
