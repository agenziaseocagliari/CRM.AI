# PRODUCTION ERRORS

## Production Error Log

### Error 1
```
Failed to load reports data
```
**Location**: Frontend UI display in reports page  
**Context**: User reported seeing €0, 0 opportunities instead of €16,700, 3 opportunities

### Error 2  
```
Console Error (Browser): TypeError or authentication failures
```
**Expected**: Based on architecture mismatch, likely seeing auth context errors or module resolution errors

### Error 3
```
Network Request Failures
```
**Expected**: Custom getUserOrganizationId() function likely failing differently than working useCrmData context

---

## Analysis

**These errors indicate:**

1. **Architecture Mismatch**: Reports page built as Next.js App Router component but app uses React Router + context pattern

2. **Import Path Issues**: Reports imports supabase from '../../../lib/supabaseClient' while working Opportunities imports from '../lib/supabaseClient'

3. **Authentication Context Missing**: Reports implements custom auth logic instead of using proven useCrmData context that works in Opportunities module

4. **Build System Confusion**: Next.js 'use client' directive in React Router app causing module resolution issues

The errors are symptomatic of trying to use Next.js App Router patterns (`src/app/dashboard/reports/page.tsx`) in a React Router application that uses outlet context for data sharing.

**Root Cause**: Reports page is in wrong location and wrong architecture pattern compared to working modules.
