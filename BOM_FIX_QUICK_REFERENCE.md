# 🚀 BOM Fix - Quick Reference

## What Was Fixed
Removed BOM (Byte Order Mark) character corruption from migration file that caused PostgreSQL syntax errors in GitHub Actions.

## Changes Made
- ❌ **Deleted**: `supabase/migrations/20251005000004_create_extra_credits_system.sql` (corrupted with BOM)
- ✅ **Created**: `supabase/migrations/20251005000008_extra_credits_system_clean.sql` (clean UTF-8)

## Verification
```bash
# Before: UTF-8 with BOM
$ hexdump -C 20251005000004... | head -n 1
00000000  ef bb bf 2d 2d 20 3d 3d  ....-- ==
         ^^^^^^^^ BOM character!

# After: UTF-8 without BOM  
$ hexdump -C 20251005000008... | head -n 1
00000000  2d 2d 20 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d  -- =====
         ^^^^^^^^ Starts with '--' correctly!
```

## Content
All content preserved:
- ✅ Extra credits packages table
- ✅ 9 pricing tiers (AI, WhatsApp, Email)
- ✅ Organization purchases table
- ✅ Credits balance view
- ✅ 6 performance indexes
- ✅ 3 RLS policies
- ✅ consume_extra_credits() function

## Expected Impact
This fix should resolve GitHub Actions workflow failures:
- Issue #601: deploy-supabase.yml
- Issue #602: vercel-preview.yml
- Issue #603: vercel-cleanup.yml

## Next Steps
1. Merge PR to main
2. Monitor GitHub Actions for successful execution
3. Verify database migration applies successfully
