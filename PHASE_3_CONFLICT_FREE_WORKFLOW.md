## 🎯 Core Principles

### Principle 1: File Ownership

**Rule**: Each stream owns specific files and directories. No other stream modifies these without coordination.

**Why**: Eliminates the primary source of merge conflicts - multiple developers changing the same file.

### Principle 2: Modular Architecture

**Rule**: Code is organized into independent modules that can be developed in isolation.

**Why**: Reduces coupling and dependencies between streams, enabling true parallel development.

### Principle 3: Daily Synchronization

**Rule**: Every developer rebases on main at least once per day, preferably morning.

**Why**: Small, frequent conflicts are easier to resolve than large, infrequent ones.

### Principle 4: Proactive Communication

**Rule**: Announce when you'll touch a shared file before starting work.

**Why**: Coordination prevents conflicts better than resolution afterward.

### Principle 5: Small, Focused PRs

**Rule**: Each PR modifies ≤ 1500 lines and focuses on a single milestone.

**Why**: Smaller PRs are easier to review, merge, and rollback if needed.

## 🤝 Shared Files Protocol

### Critical Shared Files

These files are modified by multiple streams and require special coordination:

#### 1. package.json

**Rule**: Add dependencies only, never remove or update existing versions without team consensus.

**Process**:
```bash
# Before modifying
1. Check #phase3-coordination channel for pending package.json changes
2. Announce your addition: "Adding @openai/api for Stream 3 AI features"
3. Add your dependency
4. Update in coordination channel: "✅ package.json updated with @openai/api"

# If conflict occurs
1. Both PRs approved? First to merge wins
2. Second PR rebases and accepts first PR's changes plus their own
3. Run `npm install` to verify no version conflicts
```

**Example**:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    // Stream 1 additions
    "@supabase/rate-limit": "^1.0.0",
    
    // Stream 3 additions
    "@openai/api": "^4.0.0",
    
    // Stream 4 additions
    "prometheus-client": "^14.0.0"
  }
}
```

---

#### 2. types.ts

**Rule**: Add new types only. Never modify existing type definitions.

**Process**:
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: Add new types at the end
export interface RateLimitConfig {  // Stream 1
  maxRequests: number
  windowMs: number
}

export interface WorkflowVersion {  // Stream 2
  id: string
  version: number
  workflow_json: object
}

export interface SentimentScore {   // Stream 3
  score: number
  sentiment: 'positive' | 'negative' | 'neutral'
}

// ❌ WRONG: Modifying existing type
export interface User {
  id: string
  email: string
  role: string  // Don't change this!
}
```

**If you must modify existing type**:
1. Discuss in architecture meeting
2. Coordinate with all affected streams
3. Create migration plan
4. Update all streams simultaneously

---

#### 3. README.md

**Rule**: Each stream owns a specific section. Update only your section.

**Structure**:
```markdown
# Guardian AI CRM

## Overview
[Core team maintains]

## Features

### 🔐 Security & Rate Limiting
[Stream 1 owns this section]
- API Rate Limiting
- Enhanced Audit Logging
- IP Whitelisting

### ⚙️ Advanced Workflows
[Stream 2 owns this section]
- Workflow Versioning
- Template Marketplace
- Conditional Logic

### 🤖 AI Enhancement
[Stream 3 owns this section]
...

[Continue for each stream]
```

**Process**:
```bash
# Update only your section
1. Find your section in README
2. Add your features
3. Don't modify other sections
4. Keep formatting consistent
```

---

#### 4. vite.config.ts / tsconfig.json

**Rule**: Minimal changes only. Discuss all changes in architecture meeting.

**When to modify**:
- Adding new path alias (coordinate with team lead)
- Adding build optimization (after testing)

**Process**:
1. Propose change in team meeting
2. Get consensus
3. One person makes the change
4. All streams rebase after merge

---

## 📅 Daily Workflow

### Morning Routine (Every Developer)

```bash
# 1. Check team coordination channel
# Look for:
# - Overnight merges
# - Shared file modifications
# - Blocking issues

# 2. Sync with main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 3. Rebase your work
git checkout phase3/{stream}/m{N}-{name}
git rebase main

# 4. Resolve any conflicts
# (Should be minimal if you sync daily)

# 5. Run tests
npm run lint
npm run build
npm test  # If applicable

# 6. Announce your day's plan
# "Working on M07 AI suggestions today. Will modify:
#  - src/lib/ai/workflowSuggestions.ts (new)
#  - package.json (add @openai/api)
#  - types.ts (add SuggestionResult type)"
```

---

### Before Starting Work

```bash
# 1. Review milestone file ownership
# Check PHASE_3_CONFLICT_FREE_WORKFLOW.md (this doc)
# Ensure your planned files are in your stream's ownership

# 2. Check for shared files
# If you need to modify package.json, types.ts, README, etc.
# Announce in coordination channel

# 3. Create/checkout branch
git checkout -b phase3/{stream}/m{N}-{name}

# 4. Start development
```

---

### During Development

```bash
# 1. Commit frequently
git add .
git commit -m "feat(m07): implement context analyzer"

# 2. Push to remote periodically
git push origin phase3/{stream}/m{N}-{name}

# 3. If you need to modify shared file
# - Announce in coordination channel
# - Check no one else is modifying it
# - Make minimal change
# - Announce completion

# 4. Stay in your owned files
# Don't stray into other streams' territory
```

---

### Before Opening PR

```bash
# 1. Final rebase on main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout phase3/{stream}/m{N}-{name}
git rebase main

# 2. Full test suite
npm run lint
npm run build
npm test

# 3. Review your changes
git diff main --stat
# Ensure only expected files modified

# 4. Create PR with checklist
# Use template from PHASE_3_QUICK_REFERENCE.md

# 5. Announce PR in team channel
# "@team PR #XXX ready for review: M07 AI Suggestions"
```

---

### After PR Merge

```bash
# 1. Celebrate! 🎉

# 2. Delete branch
git branch -d phase3/{stream}/m{N}-{name}
git push origin --delete phase3/{stream}/m{N}-{name}

# 3. Update tracking
vim PHASE_3_MILESTONE_TRACKING.md
# Mark milestone as completed

# 4. Announce completion
# "✅ M07 merged! AI Suggestions now available."

# 5. Help others rebase
# Be available to help teammates who need to rebase on your changes
```

---

## 🔔 Coordination Mechanisms

### 1. Shared Coordination Channel

**Platform**: Slack / Discord / Teams

**Purpose**: Real-time coordination on shared files

**Usage**:
```
[Developer A]: 🔧 Modifying package.json to add @openai/api for M07
[Developer B]: 👍 Go ahead, I'll wait
[Developer A]: ✅ Done, pushed to main
[Developer B]: 🔄 Rebasing now

[Developer C]: ⚠️ Need to update types.ts for M13 tenant context
[Developer D]: I'm also updating types.ts for M02 audit logs
[Developer C]: Can you go first? I'll rebase after
[Developer D]: Sure, will ping when done
```

---

### 2. Daily Standup (Async or Sync)

**Format**:
```
Stream 1 - Security:
- ✅ M01 Rate Limiting merged yesterday
- 🔄 M02 Audit Logging in progress (80%)
- 📅 M03 IP Whitelisting starting tomorrow

Stream 2 - Workflows:
- 🔄 M04 Versioning in progress (50%)
- 📅 M05 Marketplace planning phase
- ⚠️ M04 blocked on database decision (need architecture meeting)

[Continue for all streams]
```

---

### 3. Milestone Tracking Document

**File**: `PHASE_3_MILESTONE_TRACKING.md`

**Update Frequency**: Daily or after any status change

**What to Update**:
- Status (Not Started → In Progress → In Review → Completed)
- Blockers
- Assignee
- Start/End dates
- PR link

---

### 4. Weekly Architecture Meeting

**Purpose**: Resolve blocking issues, coordinate shared file changes, review technical decisions

**Agenda**:
1. Review blockers
2. Discuss shared file modifications planned for next week
3. Technical decisions requiring team consensus
4. Architecture changes
5. Risk review

---

### 5. PR Review Protocol

**Reviewer Assignment**:
- Primary reviewer: Stream owner
- Secondary reviewer: Team lead
- Cross-stream reviewer: For shared file changes

**Review Checklist**:
- [ ] Changes only in owned files (or coordinated shared files)
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing code
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] PR size reasonable (< 1500 lines)
- [ ] Clear description

**SLA**: Reviews within 24 hours

---

## 🔧 Conflict Resolution

### When Conflicts Happen

Despite best efforts, conflicts may occur. Here's how to handle them:

#### Type 1: Small Conflicts (< 10 lines)

**Cause**: Minor overlaps in shared files

**Resolution**:
```bash
# 1. Rebase on main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout your-branch
git rebase main

# 2. Resolve conflicts
# Git will pause on conflicted files
# Edit files to keep both changes when possible

# 3. Mark as resolved
git add .
git rebase --continue

# 4. Test
npm run lint
npm run build
npm test

# 5. Force push
git push origin your-branch --force-with-lease
```

**Time to resolve**: < 30 minutes

---

#### Type 2: Medium Conflicts (10-50 lines)

**Cause**: Multiple streams modified related code

**Resolution**:
```bash
# 1. Understand both changes
git checkout main
git show <commit-hash>  # See what changed in main

# 2. Discuss with other developer
# Slack: "@developer can we coordinate on types.ts conflicts?"

# 3. Decide on resolution together
# - Keep both changes (preferred)
# - Merge logic
# - Refactor to eliminate conflict

# 4. Resolve as above
git rebase main
# ... resolve ...
git rebase --continue

# 5. Get re-review if logic changed significantly
```

**Time to resolve**: 1-2 hours

---

#### Type 3: Large Conflicts (> 50 lines)

**Cause**: Lack of coordination, architectural mismatch

**Resolution**:
```bash
# 1. Stop and assess
git rebase --abort

# 2. Schedule meeting with affected developers
# "We have large conflicts between M02 and M07. Let's sync."

# 3. Meeting agenda:
# - Review both implementations
# - Decide on unified approach
# - Determine who refactors what
# - Timeline for resolution

# 4. Possible outcomes:
# a. Rebase one PR on the other
# b. Both PRs refactor to common interface
# c. One PR waits for other to merge, then rebases

# 5. Document decision
# Update PHASE_3_ROADMAP.md with any dependency changes
```

**Time to resolve**: 0.5-1 day

**Prevention**: This should be rare if coordination protocols are followed

---

## ✨ Best Practices

### 1. Ownership Mindset

**Principle**: "I own these files. I'm a guest in shared files."

**Actions**:
- Be possessive of your owned files (quality, design, tests)
- Be respectful in shared files (minimal changes, coordination)
- Help others when they have questions about your files

---

### 2. Communication Over Perfection

**Principle**: "When in doubt, ask."

**Actions**:
- Ask before modifying shared files
- Announce when you need to coordinate
- Be responsive when others need your input
- Over-communicate rather than under-communicate

---

### 3. Small Batches

**Principle**: "Ship often, ship small."

**Actions**:
- Break large milestones into smaller PRs if > 1500 lines
- Merge frequently
- Don't hoard work
- Enable others to build on your work sooner

---

### 4. Test Locally First

**Principle**: "Don't use CI as your testing ground."

**Actions**:
- Always run full test suite before pushing
- Test integration with latest main
- Verify builds pass
- Check for TypeScript errors

---

### 5. Documentation as Code

**Principle**: "If it's not documented, it doesn't exist."

**Actions**:
- Document as you code, not after
- Update README in same PR as feature
- Write clear commit messages
- Add comments for complex logic

---

### 6. Respect the Checklist

**Principle**: "The checklist exists for a reason."

**Actions**:
- Use PR checklist for every PR
- Don't skip steps
- Update checklist if it's missing something
- Hold others accountable to checklist

---

### 7. Be a Good Citizen

**Principle**: "Leave the codebase better than you found it."

**Actions**:
- Fix nearby issues if quick
- Improve error messages
- Add missing types
- Delete dead code
- Update outdated comments

---
