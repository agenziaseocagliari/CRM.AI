## TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR USER

### Step 1: Open Browser with Console
1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/dashboard/automation`
2. Open Browser Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Clear console for clean output

### Step 2: Verify ReactFlow Initialization
**Expected Console Output:**
```
üöÄ ReactFlow initialized successfully at [timestamp]
üìä ReactFlow instance methods: [array of method names]
```

### Step 3: Test Drag-Drop Functionality
1. **Drag any node** from sidebar to canvas
2. **Watch console** for these messages:

**Expected Console Output (Drag-Drop):**
```
üéØ DROP EVENT TRIGGERED
üì¶ reactFlowWrapper: EXISTS
üîß reactFlowInstance: EXISTS
üìÑ Node data received: [JSON data]
‚úÖ Node definition parsed: [node name]
üìç Calculated position: {x: number, y: number}
üéâ NEW NODE CREATED: {id, label, position, category}
‚úÖ NODES STATE UPDATED:
   Previous count: [number]
   New count: [number]
   All node IDs: [array]
‚úÖ NEW NODE CONFIRMED IN STATE: [node name]
```

### Step 4: Visual Verification
- **Node should appear on canvas** at drop location
- **Node should have styling** (background color, border, etc.)
- **Node should be selectable** and moveable

### Step 5: Test AI Modal

## EXPECTED RESULTS

### ‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [ ] ReactFlow initializes successfully
- [ ] Drag-drop console logs appear
- [ ] Node appears visually on canvas
- [ ] Node persists in state (confirmed in console)
- [ ] Health check connects to Railway service  
- [ ] AI modal shows correct status
- [ ] Workflow generation works

### ‚ùå FAILURE INDICATORS
- No console logs during drag-drop
- Node disappears after drop
- Error messages in console

## USER ACTION REQUIRED

**Please follow testing steps above and report:**

1. **Screenshot of console output** during drag-drop
2. **Screenshot of canvas** showing dropped node
3. **Screenshot of AI modal** showing agent status
4. **Any error messages** encountered

**This will confirm if the issue is resolved or identify remaining problems.**
