  - Check: "Custom Access Token" hook is enabled
  - Verify: Function is set to `custom_access_token_hook`

- [ ] Verify profiles table has role column
  ```sql
  SELECT column_name, data_type 
  FROM information_schema.columns 
  WHERE table_name = 'profiles' AND column_name = 'role';
  ```

- [ ] Create/verify test superadmin user
  ```sql
  SELECT id, email, role FROM profiles WHERE role = 'super_admin';
  ```

### 2. Frontend Deployment

**Build and Deploy:**

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Build for production
npm run build

# 3. Test build locally (optional)
