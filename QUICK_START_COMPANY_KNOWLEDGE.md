   - Stats cards showing 0 sources
   - Clean, professional UI

### STEP 4: Test File Upload (optional)

1. Click "Carica File" button
2. Select a PDF file
3. Click "Carica X file"
4. ✅ Should see success message
5. Check Supabase Storage bucket for uploaded file
6. Check `company_knowledge_sources` table for new record

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

**Problem**: "Cannot find module" error  
**Fix**: Restart dev server (`npm run dev`)

**Problem**: Tab not appearing  
**Fix**: Hard reload browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
