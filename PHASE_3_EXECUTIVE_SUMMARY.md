## üìã Approach: Modular vs Unified

### ‚úÖ Recommended: Modular Approach

**Why Modular?**
- **Risk Mitigation**: Deploy incrementally, rollback granularly
- **Conflict-Free**: 24 separate PRs, minimal merge conflicts
- **Continuous Value**: Deploy features as completed
- **Quality Reviews**: Focused PRs (100-500 lines vs 2000+)
- **Team Scalability**: Parallel work across 7 streams

**Success Evidence**:
- Industry best practice (Google, Amazon, Netflix)
- Proven track record in complex projects
- Enables A/B testing and gradual rollouts

### ‚ùå Not Recommended: Unified Approach

**Why Not?**
- **High Conflict Risk**: 8+ feature streams, same codebase
- **Review Difficulty**: Single PR with 2000+ lines
- **All-or-Nothing Deploy**: No gradual rollout capability
- **Team Bottleneck**: Sequential work, developer waiting time
- **Delayed ROI**: No value until everything is complete
